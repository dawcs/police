Police is declarative authorization library inspired by https://github.com/ryanb/cancan
It uses clojure multimethods under the hood and is highly experimental

## Usage

```clojure
(:require '[police.core :refer [can! cant! can? any]])

(can? :i :go :home) ;; => false
(can! :i :go :home)
(can? :i :go :home) ;; => true
(cant! any :go :home)
(can? :boss :go :home) ;; => false
(can? :i :go :home) ;; => true
```
